When the program is compiled and run, it gives the following output

gcc Example2.c -o Example2

$./Example2

enter a character

f

f

g

g

c

c

When the letter f is inserted the loop repeats itself and a user is requested to input another character and so on. a != 'c' will loop until a is equal to 'c'. when character 'c' is finally inserted the loop stops and the program terminates.
